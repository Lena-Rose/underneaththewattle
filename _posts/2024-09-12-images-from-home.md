I was writing on the veranda one day, and there was a faint sweet smell in the air, drifting in on small breezes. I was still new in town then, and in many ways I still am, so it took me a while to figure out that the smell was coming from the yellow wattle, reaching up from the ground and encircling a corner of the veranda. It was August then, and summer was far off, but so was winter. 

I wanted to drink in the smell. Each new gust of wind carried it. I live somewhere else now, but the smell lingered in the streets, until it was replaced with that of frangipane flowers. The river flows past the State Library as I worked; where I live now, it flows below the hill.
